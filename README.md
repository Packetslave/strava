strava
======

**UPDATE**: Strava have delayed the shutdown of the v1/v2 endpoints until *June 30 2013*
Unfortunately, it sounds like they're going to be fairly selective about who gets access
to the new v3 API, and from the tone of their blog posts it doesn't sound like a generic
library such as strava.py is going to make the cut. I hope I'm wrong, and if so I will 
definitely be updating this library to work with v3.
